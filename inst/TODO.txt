----------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to make R/maanova a part of BioConductor. 
The things need to do are mainly the data structure
convertion. I should to:
1. Make functions madata2exprSet and exprSet2madata
2. Modify numerous functions to take input of
either madata or exprSet




----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is intended to contain a list of many of the additions that
are planned for the R/maanova package.

If you any additions to suggest, please send an email to Lei Wu,
