Library maanova
================

Version 1.13.2 & 1.13.3, Feb 9, 2009
- fixed issue where random terms were not getting passed to matest
  permutations when shuffle.method was set to "resid"
- fixed bad call to "Warning(...)" (should have been "warning(...)")
- fixed misc other minor documentation and metadata issues

---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.13.1, Dec 5, 2008
- did minor documentation updates
- changed get(getOption("device"))() to dev.new() since getOption breaks in R 2.8
- removed bad reference to ttest.method in clustering code
- fixed error in summarytable.R where replicates would cause a failure

---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.5.1, Aug 18, 2007

Modify the function 
Reconstruct the flow

---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.1, Apr 17, 2007
1. added the function ma.svd() to call LAPACK function DGESVD directly. It 
works the same way as the old La.svd() in R-2.3.1 and earlier.

---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.2, Mar 9, 2007

A rollback version to run on R-2.3.1 and earlier to avoid the the error
message La.svd() throw out.

---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.0, Oct 3, 2006

version run on R-2.4.0. bump up version number according bioconductor's rule.

---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.1, May 9, 2006
1. Changed the La.svd(X, method="dgesdd") to La.svd(X) since
La.svd(X, method="dgesdd" or "dgesvd") is deprecated. La.svd(X)'s 
default method is "dgesdd" from R-2.3.0.
2. Add comments in matest.Rd about test covariate in "contrast" and
"test type" section.

---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.0, Apr 23, 2006
1. Hyuna Yang made these changes:
Instead of pooled p-value, p-value based on subset method 
is implemented in matest.R. Include option critical. 
2. Correct several places in the manual files from "transform" 
to "transform.madata"
3. Changed the La.svd(X,method="dgesvd") to La.svd(X,method="dgesdd")
in util.R since the La.svd(X, method="dgesvd" is deprecated from 
R-2.3.0.
4. Version number jumps from 0.98.8 to 1.2.0 in order to 
keep up with bioconductor version number
5. For R-2.3.0, In transform.madata.R file: 
Changed	transform.rawdata <- function(x, ...) 
     to	transform.rawdata <- function(`_data`, ...)
Changed transform.madata <- function(x,
	method=c("shift","glowess","rlowess","linlog","linlogshift"),
	lolim, uplim,
	f=0.1, iter=3, degree=1,
	cg=0.3, cr=0.3, n.bin=10,
	draw=c("screen", "dev", "off"), ...) to
     to transform.madata <- function(`_data`,
	method=c("shift","glowess","rlowess","linlog","linlogshift"),
	lolim, uplim,
	f=0.1, iter=3, degree=1,
	cg=0.3, cr=0.3, n.bin=10,
        draw=c("screen", "dev", "off"), ...)
  and the corresponding transform.madata.Rd file.

--------------------------
Version 0.96-1 
Change the package to work for N-dye system. The major changes include:

1. Input files:

o Data file
  - There's no change for data file format.
o Design file
  - User must have "Array" and "Dye" columns in the design file. 
  - User must have a "Sample" column in the design file. This is equivelent
    to "SampleID" in the older version.
  - User must not have columns called "Spot" or "Label" in design file.
  - All fields are treated as factors. They don't need to be
    continous integers.

2. Functions:

o read.madata:
  - ArrayName field is removed from rawdata and madata objects

o riplot and arrayview work only for 2-dye system.

o makeModel:
   - covairate can be fixed or random
   - terms in formula must be in the design file, except "Spot"
     for spot effect and "Label" for labelling effect.

o fitmaanova:
  - levels are made for all terms
